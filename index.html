  <p>
    NuWu Cannabis Marketplace is favorite for a lot of locals. Known as one of the most unique dispensaries in Las Vegas located near the Fremont Street area, just 
    north of the Neon Museum (highly recommend you check that out after you've consumed some good bud) and Downtown Las Vegas on Paiute tribal land, NuWu operates as one of the city’s largest and most well-known 
    cannabis marketplaces.  I do feel the need to add a heads up: the walk to NuWu goes through one of the more down trodden areas of Las Vegas so I do recommend driving or taking a ride 
    to NuWu.  
  </p>

  <p>
    You will be amazed at NuWu when you see the massive open-concept space and relaxed, lounge friendly atmosphere. The property includes a full outdoor consumption lounge (for eligible guests), 
    plenty of room to browse without feeling rushed, and a vibe that’s far more chill than the crowded, tourist heavy spots closer to Fremont Street itself.
  </p>

  <p>
    NuWu is known for their generous daily deals, bulk flower options, and a wide selection of edibles, concentrates, vapes, waxes, and infused products. 
    Because it’s located just outside the Fremont area, lines tend to move faster, parking is easier, 
    and the overall experience feels more relaxed especially compared to the chaos of Fremont Street at night.

  <div class="box">
    <h2 style="margin-top:0;">FAQ: Las Vegas Dispensaries</h2>

    <p class="small">
      <strong>What is the best dispensary in Las Vegas?</strong><br>
      The best dispensary depends on a few factors:  Price and experience go hand in hand so a place like Planet 13 will be a full experience with slightly higher prices 
      where as a place like NuWu will be more of a hike, simpler shop, but lower prices. 
    </p>

    <p class="small">
      <strong>Are dispensaries close to the Las Vegas Strip?</strong><br>
      Yes. Most Strip-area dispensaries are a 5–10 minute ride from major hotels. Depending on where youre staying on the strip some dispensaries like Rise and Planet 13 are within walking distance
      from the Las Vegas Fashion Mall area while Curaleaf and Oasis are at the other end of the strip walking distance from The iconic Stratospher Hotel and Casino.  
    </p>

    <p class="small">
      <strong>Are there dispensaries near Fremont Street?</strong><br>

  </div>
    <p class="small">
      <strong> Where can I legally consume Cannabis or Marijuana in Las Vegas? </strong><br> 
      Marijuana can not legally be consumed in public. Consumption is allowed in cannabis lounges where available. Walking around The Strip or Fremont St. you may smell a lot 
      of enjoying their cannabis but that does not mean it's legal.  
      
    <p class="small" style="margin-top:22px;">
